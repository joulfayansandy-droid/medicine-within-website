# Video Implementation Analysis

## What Has Been Implemented

### 1. Video Loader Script (`js/video-loader.js`)
A comprehensive video loading system has been implemented with the following features:

- **Lazy Loading**: Videos with `data-lazy-video` attribute load only when they enter the viewport (using Intersection Observer)
- **Background Videos**: Videos with `data-background-video` autoplay, loop, and are muted
- **Click-to-Play Videos**: Videos with `data-click-to-play` show a poster image and load when clicked
- **Performance Optimized**: Videos use `preload="none"` to avoid loading until needed
- **Fallback Images**: Images are hidden when videos are ready to play

### 2. Video Locations

#### Homepage (`index.html`)
- **Temple Card**: Background video (`sandi-group-2.mov`) - Should autoplay as background

#### Temple Page (`temple.html`)
- **Hero Section**: Background video (`sandi-group-1.mov`) - Should autoplay as background
- **Gallery Section**: Lazy-loaded video (`sandi-group-1.mov`) - Loads when scrolled into view
- **Featured Section**: Click-to-play video (`sandi-group-3.mov`) - Loads when poster is clicked

#### Retreats Page (`retreats.html`)
- Multiple lazy-loaded videos in gallery sections
- Featured click-to-play videos

#### Mentorship Page (`mentorship.html`)
- Featured click-to-play videos

### 3. Video Files
All video files are located in `assets/videos/`:
- `sandi-group-1.mov`
- `sandi-group-2.mov`
- `sandi-group-3.mov`
- `sandi-group-4.mov`
- `sandi-group-5.mov`
- `sandi-group-6.mov`

## Issues Found

### Critical Issue: Video Format Compatibility

**Problem**: The videos are in `.mov` format (QuickTime), which has limited browser support:
- ✅ **Safari**: Full support for `.mov` files
- ⚠️ **Chrome/Edge**: Limited support, may not play
- ❌ **Firefox**: No native support for `.mov` files

**Current Status**:
- Video loader script is working correctly
- Videos are being detected and source elements are being added
- **BUT**: Videos are not actually loading/playing because:
  1. Browser doesn't support `.mov` format (Chrome/Firefox)
  2. Network requests show video files are NOT being requested
  3. Video `readyState` remains at 0 (not loaded)

### Testing Results

From browser testing on `temple.html`:
- ✅ Video elements are present in DOM
- ✅ Video loader script is loaded and running
- ✅ Source elements are being added to videos
- ❌ Video files are NOT being requested from server
- ❌ Videos are not playing
- ✅ Fallback images are visible (as expected when videos don't load)

## Solutions

### Option 1: Convert Videos to MP4 (Recommended)
Convert all `.mov` files to `.mp4` format for universal browser support:

```bash
# Using ffmpeg (if installed)
for file in assets/videos/*.mov; do
    ffmpeg -i "$file" -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -movflags +faststart "${file%.mov}.mp4"
done
```

Then update HTML files to use `.mp4` instead of `.mov`.

### Option 2: Provide Multiple Formats
Provide both `.mov` and `.mp4` versions and let the browser choose:

```html
<video>
    <source src="assets/videos/sandi-group-1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    <source src="assets/videos/sandi-group-1.mov" type="video/quicktime">
</video>
```

### Option 3: Use Video Hosting Service
Host videos on YouTube, Vimeo, or Cloudflare Stream for better compatibility and performance.

## Next Steps

1. **Convert videos to MP4 format** (recommended)
2. **Update video paths** in HTML files from `.mov` to `.mp4`
3. **Test video playback** in multiple browsers
4. **Optimize video files** for web (compression, resolution)

## Technical Details

### Video Loader Implementation
- Uses Intersection Observer API for lazy loading
- Handles autoplay with proper error handling
- Manages fallback images visibility
- Supports both lazy-load and click-to-play patterns

### CSS Styling
- Videos are styled to be full-width/height in containers
- Fallback images fade out when videos are ready
- Proper z-index layering for background videos

### Browser Compatibility
- Intersection Observer: Supported in all modern browsers
- Video autoplay: Requires muted attribute (already implemented)
- Video formats: `.mov` has limited support (main issue)
