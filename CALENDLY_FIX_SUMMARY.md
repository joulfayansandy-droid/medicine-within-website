# Calendly Integration Fix - Summary

## Overview
Fixed the Calendly integration issues by simplifying the over-engineered implementation and standardizing all booking links across the website.

## Changes Made

### 1. Simplified Popup Widget Function (`build_1/js/main.js`)
- **Before**: Complex polling logic with interval checking and multiple timeout handlers
- **After**: Cleaner, more reliable implementation following Calendly's best practices
- **Improvements**:
  - Removed complex interval polling
  - Added URL validation
  - Improved error handling with try-catch blocks
  - Better fallback behavior when Calendly doesn't load
  - Pop-up blocker detection
  - Clearer error messages for debugging

### 2. Standardized Booking Links
- **Fixed**: `build_1/mentorship.html` (line 555) - Changed from direct `Calendly.initPopupWidget()` call to standardized `openCalendlyPopup()` function
- **Verified**: All other pages already use the consistent pattern with fallback

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added URL validation before attempting to open
- Improved fallback function with better error messages
- Added pop-up blocker detection
- Graceful degradation if Calendly fails to load

## Files Modified

1. `build_1/js/main.js`
   - Simplified `openCalendlyPopup()` function (lines 213-251)
   - Enhanced `openCalendlyFallback()` function (lines 254-279)
   - Function remains globally available via `window.openCalendlyPopup`

2. `build_1/mentorship.html`
   - Standardized booking link (line 555) to use `openCalendlyPopup()`

## Configuration

The Calendly URL is configured in `build_1/js/config.js`:
```javascript
calendly: {
    discovery: 'https://calendly.com/joulfayansandy/discovery-call-30-minutes'
}
```

## Important Notes

### Calendar Availability Issue
The error "This calendar is currently unavailable" is **NOT a code issue** - it's a Calendly account configuration issue. To fix:

1. **Log into Calendly account** (joulfayansandy)
2. **Verify the event type URL** is correct: `discovery-call-30-minutes`
3. **Check calendar settings**:
   - Ensure the event type is set to **"Public"**
   - Verify the event is active and not paused
   - Check that the event has available time slots
4. **Test the URL directly**: Visit `https://calendly.com/joulfayansandy/discovery-call-30-minutes` in a browser to verify it works

### If Calendar Still Shows Unavailable
- The calendar may need to be republished in Calendly
- Check Calendly account status (free vs paid plan limitations)
- Verify the event type slug matches exactly in the URL

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Verify calendar URL works when accessed directly in browser
- [ ] Test popup widget on homepage (floating button)
- [ ] Test booking links on all pages:
  - [ ] Homepage (index.html)
  - [ ] Kambo page (kambo.html) - multiple links
  - [ ] Mentorship page (mentorship.html) - multiple links
  - [ ] Temple page (temple.html)
  - [ ] Retreats page (retreats.html)
- [ ] Test on mobile devices
- [ ] Test with slow network connection
- [ ] Test with pop-up blocker enabled (should fallback to new tab)
- [ ] Test with ad blocker (may need to disable)
- [ ] Verify fallback works when Calendly script fails to load

## How It Works

1. **User clicks booking link** → Calls `openCalendlyPopup()`
2. **Function checks** if Calendly script is loaded
3. **If loaded**: Opens popup widget immediately
4. **If not loaded**: Waits up to 5 seconds for script to load
5. **Fallback**: If Calendly fails, opens booking page in new tab

All booking links have inline fallback that opens the URL directly if the JavaScript function isn't available.

## Browser Compatibility

Works in all modern browsers. Falls back gracefully if:
- JavaScript is disabled
- Calendly script fails to load
- Pop-up blockers are enabled
- Network connectivity is poor
